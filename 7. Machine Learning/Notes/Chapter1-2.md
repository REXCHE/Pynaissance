### I. Chapter 1, A Primer

1. General Model Categories: 

- Classification: Predict discrete values
- Regression: Predict continuous values. 
- Multi-classification: Sample can have multiple labels. 
- Clustering: Unsupervised learning, training samples does not have labels

2. Training, Validation, and Testing

- Training set is used to train the model, i.e. calculate variables from parameters. 
- Validation set is used to fine-tune the model's hyperparameter
- Testing is used to validate a model's generalization characteristics.
